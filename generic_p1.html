							<h1>Calculating Returns on Capital Projects in the Consumer Product Goods Industry</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/rona.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In the Consumer Product Goods industry, profitability is driven by selling increasingly more goods, and the production of these goods is enabled by large capital projects in manufacturing.  These types of projects are a necessity to the business and  finding those with the highest returns is a challenging task that demands a thorough analysis.</p>
							<p>There is high risk against projects that involve purchasing manufacturing equipment and building facilities.  New equipment in particular is high in cost, can rarely be re-purposed (as it is custom-built and difficult to transport), and depreciates quickly over a ten-year period.  In addition, long-lead times and complex installations require that equipment is purchased many years in advance of forecasted sales.  This makes it impossible to grow supply and demand in sync; either you have a shortage of capacity resulting in lost sales or idle capacity meaning dollars wasted.</p>
							<p>The importance of capital projects and the risk associated with them means it is essential to have a strong process for evaluating them so that the most profitable projects are selected.  In my experience, the best approach for calculating returns is to use the RONA model.  This model assesses upfront capital against its annual financial benefit during the life of the asset (assumed to be 10 years for equipment and 30 years for building), painting an accurate picture of how much earnings are being squeezed out of an asset.  There are three main pieces to this analysis; benefit, cost, and capital.</p>
							<p class="subtitle">Benefit</p>
							<p>Unless you've got a crystal ball, determining future benefits is essentially guesswork - import guesswork, as itâ€™s the first assumption that needs to be made to drive the business case for the project.  Typically for an analysis its necessary to know how much volume is expected to sell and the price per unit volume at the sku level.  This level of granularity is important - one lumpsum estimate will not work as different skus have different costs and throughputs associated with them (a little more on this later).</p>
							
							<p class="subtitle">Cost</p>
							<p>The cost of product for a new sku or change in cost of product of an existing sku could have a positive or negative impact on the overall benefit of the project.  For example, direct labour cost could increase if complex equipment is involved, or decrease with a higher level of automation.  Some other costs to consider are: utilities (electricity, water), packaging (labels, plastics, cartons, etc.), raw materials, and overhead.  Downsizing presents an interesting problem; while reducing the size of finished goods could result in less material costs, a potential decrease in throughput (less kilos produced per hour) would result in more direct labour and overhead absorbed per kilo.  </p>
							
							<p class="subtitle">Capital</p>
							<p>The capital budget required for a project must be minimized while enabling enough capacity to produce the expected volume.  However, estimating capacity is a complex exercise with many moving parts.  In general, a model should be created to account for factors like product mix, inefficiencies, yield losses, shelf-life, and seasonality.</p>
							<p>The <i>product mix</i> accounts for each sku having a unique throughput at different steps in a manufacturing process.  If a sku has a relatively low throughput, it will consume relatively more production hours than a high throughput sku.  So in some cases even if one product takes accounts for only 10% of the annual demand, it could consume 80% of the production hours in the year if its throughput is low enough.</p>
							<p><i>Inefficiencies</i> refer to things like change-overs (the time it takes for maintenance to swap out tooling on custom equipment for different skus), batching (for non-continuous processes like mixing in a blender, there are inefficiency losses if a full batch is not scheduled), downtime, etc.  </p>
							<p><i>Yield losses</i> refer to product that is lost throughout the process.  One example is if product is damaged or destroyed when a machine malfunctions.  Yield loss may also occur as part of the process - for example, when canned soup is manufactured some water may evaporate during the cooking process.  </p>
							<p><i>Bottlenecks</i> refer to the concept of an assembly line being as fast as its slowest worker.  The bottleneck can occur at different stages in the process for different skus, making it near impossible to balance a line perfectly.  </p>
							<p><i>Shelf-life</i> presents complexities around scheduling i.e. short shelf-life means more frequent production and more change-overs, as product has a limit on how long it can sit in a warehouse.  </p>
							<p><i>Seasonality</i> refers to fluctuation in demand through-out the year (e.g. some skus may have higher demand during summer months) needs to be modelled in conjunction with shelf-life so that storage can be optimized against the capacity of the machinery.  For example, if I have double the regular volume in July and no storage capacity, I need to budget for equipment that works twice as hard.</p>
