							<h1>Cookie Classification</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/choco_chip.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Six months ago when quarantine started and I suddenly had the time to tackle my pipeline of new hobbies, baking great cookies was first on my list.  So I bought a hand-mixer, googled some recipes, went crazy at bulk barn, and then baked and delivered dozens of cookies to family and friends.  While I'm sure that I would have gotten positive feedback on my cookies based on the gesture alone, some cookies were definitely bigger hits than others.  I immediately became curious about what made a good recipe. </p>
							<p>I started by googling cookie science.  What's great about cookies is that the ingredients are more or less the same (i.e. four, butter, baking soda, baking powder, sugar, egg, vanilla), but how you combine them yields drastically different results.  After devouring many websites, I put together a summary of expected inputs (ingredient ratios and baking methods) and expected outputs (cookie characteristics) based on my findings.  </p>
							<p>Most of this made sense but the theory was qualitative, and I wanted quantitative results.   If I could conduct thousands of cookie experiments within a realistic time-frame I would measure characteristics like spread by testing how cookie diameter increases with butter content and quantify crispiness by testing at what height a cookie shatters.  Instead, I decided to do a similar analysis with machine learning.</p>
							<p>While intuitively I wanted to run a linear regression algorithm to model the relationship between cookie characteristics and their ingredients, I didn't have the data for it.  However, by web-scraping I could get a data set of recipes and assign them each a binary classification by searching for key words in their titles and description.  For example, I could classify cookies as either crispy or chewy, thick or thin, smooth or wrinkled.  I decided to do this for the most popular cookie I knew - the chocolate chip cookie.  </p>
							<p>My process was to:</p>
							<p>1) Web scrape 80 'crispy' recipes and 80 'chewy' recipes <br />
							   2) Calculate the weight percentage of main ingredients (flour, butter, sugar, egg) and create side-by-side box plots <br />
							   3) Calculate the weight percentage of ingredient components (protein, fat, sucrose, molasses, water) and create side-by-side box plots<br />
							   4) Create 2D graphs of fat vs protein and sucrose vs protein to test hypothesis that chewy cookies have high protein, low fat, and low sucrose<br />
							   5) Run a classification algorithm to predict if cookies are "crispy" or "chewy" based on composition<br />
